Using Z3 to Find an Optimal Twiddler Configuration

This twiddler configuration is a work in progress please give us a hand!

Note: The configurations currently generated are poor because the model (wrongly) assumes that all chord presses take exactly 0.5 seconds. Once this is updated to a more realistic model, the configurations should be more coherrent.
